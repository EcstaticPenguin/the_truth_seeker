      <h1 class="title">Poverty</h1>
      <p>The word poverty comes from the Latin word pauper, meaning poor. So poverty can be defined as a state of being extremely poor. We
        generally think that being poor means not having enough money to buy the necessities. But if we look at the broader
        aspect poverty can mean many things. Like it could also mean mental
        poverty/illness.

      <h1 class="title">Mental Poverty</h1>

      <br><br>
      <p>So you might be wondering why I compared Mental illness with poverty. For this, we have to first look at the definition
        of mental illness. Mental health disorders refer to a wide range of mental health conditions â€” disorders that affect your mood,
        thinking, and behavior. Examples of mental illness include depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders,
        and addictive behaviors. Many people have mental health concerns from time to time. But a mental health concern becomes
        a mental illness when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect your ability to function.</p>
      <p>Let's be honest guys most of us face mental illness from time to time although it is minor so we get
        recovered from it quickly. I am a student and I can tell thousands of points
        on how students face mental illness. Try to relate things given below this may help you in
        understanding the problem and you may be able to cure your problem.</p>
     <ul>
       <li>The most important thing that first leads to mental poverty is being at the top. Let us together see how it happens.
       First of all, if we see from our childhood we can clearly find that being at the top is given the most importance
       Here I am not saying only being top at education field but being in top at any field. But the thing is that is this what we really desire?
        Let's see a practical example that will help us to understand the mentality of today's human being
      . Let's say that two boys Vinod and Ajay are good friends and Ajay is slightly better in studies than Vinod, both of their conditioning is done
       in such a way that both want to be at the top. Let's say that Ajay scores 90 marks in exams whereas Vinod scored 85 marks in exams and the class topper
       scored 98 marks but here we can see that Ajay shows his superiority by saying his parents that see Vinod scored 85 and I scored 90. Even I have to sadly
       say that most of the parents also have the habit to ask the marks of others and then compare it with your marks. Do you know why students have such a mentality?
       They do this so that they can satisfy themselves that they are great and secondly they want some fame like they want that people should know that they are intelligent
       or at least to prove themselves intelligent than other fellow members.
    <br><br>
    So you might be thinking how this is mental poverty, Yes this is mental poverty as you are considering your success by taking others as your reference frame like if he or she scores less than me then at least I can be proud of myself that I scored more than them.
    than him/her. Here the mind is devoid of thinking what is right and what is wrong.
    <br><br>
    So now what's the solution to this big issue. I would say that people should change their mentality in such a way that it is like
    I don't care what's others marks, I just want to give my best. Now I can add many this
    regarding this topic but I want that you should also give some time to analyze the problem
    and try to figure it out on your own way of how can you resolve this big issue.
   </li>
   <br><hr><br>
   <li>The second problem is the most common mental illness from which most of us are suffering most of the time. This is the
      inability to control our brain. Sometimes we may have sudden emotional ups and downs and sometimes we may also get lost
      in our own imagination. Like, let me relate this topic with the student's life. The first thing to notice is that when
      we study or do any other thing we often get distracted by mobile phones, the noise inside the home, unrealistic thoughts
      running in the brain, etc. People often say that technology (generally for mobile phones and laptops) is making us distracted
      and dull. But here we must not rely on what others say. Let me say my point of view. I feel like it is the inability of the
      person to control his/her brain according to the way they want. This is the same as not having sufficient skills
      to control the brain. Thus it can be also classified as a kind of poverty.
      <br><br>
      So what's the solution to this. You might be wondering how can you control the brain and always make
      it function the way you want. There is a technique called yoga or meditation. I know most of you know this
      but you never felt interested or got time to do this. Let me tell you that yoga is very essential just like
      brushing our teeth and bathing daily is essential in a similar way yoga is essential for our well-being.
